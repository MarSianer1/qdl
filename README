Buffer size
========
**Warning**
Using this parameter might not work stable on your system. Read [760b3df](https://github.com/andersson/qdl/commit/760b3dffb03d2b7dfb82c6eac652a092f51c572d) for

To improve flashing speed buffer size parameter was added.
It uses bigger buffers for sending data on USB what allows to flash
faster.

Measurements made on VM Linux Mint 21.1 and may vary compared to native
machine.
